# gitexample
This repository has been created to familiarize with merge conflict, stash, pop and pull request

# Getting Started
The purpose of this repository is to familiarize my students with common git commands, especillay with merge conflicts, how to resolve them, using stash and popping stash.

I want you to send me your git username, so I can add you as a collaborator.

Once that is done, clone this in your local environemnt.
To clone it, you can either use VS code, you can just click on the clone via VS code option or, you can do it manually by copying the repo url and cloning it through command.


# Next Step

Once you have successfully cloned the repository, 
 1. Create a new branch in your local
 2. name it by your roll no
 3.  Add the following code after line no 223

<div class="formgroup" id="message-form">
    <label for="your-name">Your name, your year, your roll no</label>
    <textarea id="your-roll-no" name="your-name"></textarea>
</div>

### please add your name instead of "your-name or Your name". Follow suit for roll no too.
4. commit your changes. 
5. We will then push the changes to our own local branch
6. we will send a pull request to the main repo, that is this repo.
7. We will start merging PR. We may merge only few PRs when doing so due to shortage of time.
