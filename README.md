# gitexample
This repository has been created to familiarize with merge conflict, stash, pop and pull request

# Getting Started
The purpose of this repository is to familiarize my students with common git commands, especillay with merge conflicts, how to resolve them, using stash and popping stash.

I want you to send me your git username, so I can add you as a collaborator.

Once that is done, clone this in your local environemnt.
To clone it, you can either use VS code, you can just click on the clone via VS code option or, you can do it manually by copying the repo url and cloning it through command.
